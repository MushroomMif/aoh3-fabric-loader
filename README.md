AOH3 Fabric Loader
===========
This is a version of Fabric Loader, originally created for Minecraft modding,
modified for working with Age of History 3 game.
The loader is fully working now and looks stable, but the whole ecosystem around
it is still in beta so expect some bugs and flaws while using it.

# How to use it:
> [!WARNING]
> Fabric loader does not work with beta version of the game,
> it works only with the stable version
1. Go to "Actions" page of this repository, open a last action and
download its artifacts
2. Unzip downloaded archive into the game directory
3. Download
[an archive with required libraries](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/lNFkjFRI_5MzUQ)
and also unzip it to the game directory
4. If you are using Windows:<br/>
Create a `start.bat` file in the game directory and write
`"jre/bin/java.exe" -cp "./*" net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.KnotClient` there
<br/><br/>
If you are using Mac:<br/>
   - Download and install [JRE 8](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=mac&package=jre&version=8&arch=any)
   - Create a `start.sh` file in the game directory and write the following there
   ```shell
   #!/bin/sh
   java -cp "./*" net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.KnotClient
   ```
5. Open the created file, it will launch the game with the loader
6. Now you can put mods into `mods` directory (we recommend you to install
   [AOH3 Fabric Api](https://github.com/MushroomMif/aoh3-fabric-api) right away 
   as almost all mods need this for working properly) and configure
   `fabric_launch_settings.json` if needed. Enjoy!
